# Welcome!

Hi! This files contains instructions about how to setup and contribute to the project.

`Please note that instructions contained here must be adhered to in order to save time for the things that matter.`

**Steps to work with this repo**
 1. Clone the repo
 2. Create a new branch using the `git branch [branchName]` command
 3. Switch to the new branch using `git checkout [branchName]`
 4. Here's the convention for naming your branches: 
    - use `bug` or `wip` (denotes **work in progress**) to begin the branch name. 
    - follow that with the `taskName` (i.e. the name of the task you've been assigned). 
    - lastly, add your first name e.g `Sonya` (so we can easily tell who worked on the task without much fuss).
    - An example of a proper name: `wip-setup-logging-chioma` 
    - For a bugfix, use: `bug-image-alignment-issue-newton`
    - That is how you should name your branches.
5. When you complete a specific task, add it, make your commit, and  push that branch using `git push origin [branchName]`.

Cheers all the way!
